### Project Description
[We are introducing weather app for MARTIANS. Our weather app is designed specifically for MARS,
providing real-time atmospheric and environment data for martian inhabitants by using accurate
information from NASA,ISRO]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[MARTIANS, long accustomed to the planet's thin atmosphere and upredictable dust storms, face the daily challenge of planning their intercrater travel ,agricultural project,and outdoor leisure activities without a reliable way to forecast mars' notoriusly unpredictable weather. while earthlings rely on dailyapps and update to navigate rain,snow,or sun,mars colonists have been left stranded withuot accurate data 
 on the frequent dust storms , fluctuating temperature,and solar radiation spikes that dominate their environment. ]
