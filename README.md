### Project Description
We are introducing weather app for MARTIANS. Our weather app is designed specifically for MARS,
providing real-time atmospheric and environment data for martian inhabitants by using accurate
information from NASA,ISRO

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
MARTIANS, long accustomed to the planet's thin atmosphere and upredictable dust storms, face the daily challenge of planning their intercrater travel ,agricultural project,and outdoor leisure activities without a reliable way to forecast mars' notoriusly unpredictable weather. While earthlings rely on dailyapps and update to navigate rain,snow,or sun,mars colonists have been left stranded without accurate data 
on the frequent dust storms , fluctuating temperature,and solar radiation spikes that dominate their environment.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Nobody asked for it,but MARS deserves better ,right? While earthlings argue over umbrellas and sun hats,martians need a heads-up on 200 mph dust storms. With cutting-edge data sources and predictive algorithms, the mars weather app provides accurate,up-to-date information for all martians -ensuring everyone stay safe,connected, and informed, no matter where their next adventure takes them.
